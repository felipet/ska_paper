In this contribution, we have introduced the distributed DAQ systems and its specific requirements. We have also reviewed the different synchronization mechanisms. We focus on the SKA project and we briefly describes its strict timing requirements. Nowadays, there is not any standard system that can fulfill the SKA needs. The WR technology is presented because it is based on the standard protocols and its results ensure a sub-nanosecond accuracy. In this context, we present an implementation of a high accuracy PPS distribution system based on the WR technology that presents . This platform has been propsed to be integrated in the SKA infraestructure and currently, it is under a evaluation process. 
Our solution is based on the WR-ZEN which improves previous existing WR node designs 
thanks to the inclusion of the high-level software capabilities, the high accuracy gateware
design and an enhaced clock circuitry.
To provide the high-level capabilities, we have developed a Linux-based environment with some
userspace tools and drivers. The gateware design includes all the elements to implement the 
White Rabbit protocol and some additional FMC functionalities. The enhanced clocking circuitry can be configured using different schemas in order to look for the best synchronization quality results targeting the SKA needs. 

In addition to the platform development, we have also perform several test in order to check the system fulfills the strict SKA timing: 2 ns for the PPS distribution system. The results prove that the synchronization accuracy is bounded below 200ps, being significally better than the SKA need. Moreover, the scalability tests reveal that the synchronization accuracy is maintained for a high number of nodes with several network levels. Furthermore, we have 
designed several experiments simulating the SKA climatic place conditions 
looking for evaluating the thermal change influence in the propagation delay 
and its repercussion in the PPS distribution system. We observed that for a 
20ÂºC temperature difference the propagation delay is increased tens of 
nanoseconds (96 ns) but the PPS offset keeps its accuracy with an offset that 
does not exceed the hundred of picoseconds (211 ps). 

Finally, the experimental results evidence that the proposed PPS distribution system based on WR not only fits perfectly with the SKA requierements but also improve them.
