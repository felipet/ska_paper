In this section we detail the accomplished experiments and their results in 
order to evaluate the presented PPS distribution system for the SKA's timing 
system. The first experiment is a general characterization of the PPS 
distribution system. The second one emulates a example of WR network like the 
one needed to distribute timing in the SKA telescope, and evaluates the 
synchronization accuracy. Finally, the influence of external conditions over 
the fibre links and its effect on the synchronization accuracy is analysed.

The principal equipment and tools utilized during the experiments is listed 
below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two White Rabbit Switches to emulate a two-hops WR network. Both are 
    hardware version 3.4 and are flashed with the last version of the WR 
    firmware (v5.0).
    
    \item Two White Rabbit ZEN Time Provider (WR-ZEN TP) to test the 
    performance of the new developed platform as WR nodes of the SKA 
    facilities. Firmware version is 1.2 while the hardware is v3.0.
    
    \item A High-resolution counter from Keysight, the 52320A.
    
    \item Multiple components for the setup of the equipment:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small form-factor pluggable transceptors (SFPs) to establish the 
        link between WR devices. For the shorter links we've used the most 
        common bidirectional SFPs for WR: AXCEN 1310/1490 nm. For larger links, 
        we tried 
        SFPs from FiberStore: GE-BX-80 1490/1550 nm.
        \item Simplex optical fibre links (G652D). For the device 
        characterization short distance fibres have been used, meanwhile for 
        the scalability and temperature tests we have used long distance links: 
        20 and 50 km respectively.
        \item A OCXO Morion MV89 as frequency reference for the GM mode.
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PPS performance of the WR-ZEN platform}
\label{subsec: charact_zen}

With this first experimental results we present a performance analysis of the 
PPS distribution using the WR-ZEN. The connection schema is formed by two 
WR-ZENs, one as WR master and the other as WR slave, whose PPS output signals 
are introduced in a time counter to measure the offset between them. With this 
experiment we focus on the WR-ZEN performance, so that we set all the equipment 
to a constant temperature and we use a short fibre link (few meters) in order 
to avoid instability occasioned by chromatic dispersion on long fibre links.

The numerical results are included in Table \ref{tab:exp1res} and are 
represented graphically on Figures \ref{fig:mdev_exp1}, 
\ref{fig:tdev_exp1} and \ref{fig:mtie_exp1}. The slope of the Modified Allan 
Deviation curve shows that noise is dominated by white phase modulated noise. 
In the time domain, TDEV shows that the expected error is tens of ps and the 
worst-case showed in the MTIE plot is bounded around 200 ps for the sampling 
period.

The obtained values reveal that the proposed WR node for the PPS distribution 
solution fulfils the requirements to be used in the SKA PPS distribution 
system. Although, it is necessary to evaluate it in more realistic conditions 
before concluding its goodness:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluate the WR-ZEN as final node of a WR network. The purpose of 
	this device is to be placed on each acquisition instrument to provide an 
	accurate time reference. The results presented in the subsection 
	\ref{subsec: net_exp} states performance for a realistic WR deployment.
	
	\item Moreover, SKA facilities will be placed in a desert zone, and 
	the nodes will be linked by long-distance fibre links. Because of that, 
	it's 
	necessary to analyse if the meteorological conditions can degrade 
	significantly the synchronization accuracy. A thermal characterization of 
	the influence of the variation of propagation delays in the PPS accuracy is 
	presented in subsection \ref{subsec:temp}.
\end{itemize}   

\subsection{WR scalability for SKA} %% Buscar un nombre mejor
\label{subsec: net_exp}

The next experiment covers a scalability analysis of the WR solution for the 
SKA timing system. In section \ref{sec:ska} there is a estimation of the final 
nodes that need to be synchronized for the SKA: around 250 endpoints that 
must be synchronized with an accuracy below 2ns. A WR network with only two 
hops is suitable to synchronize up to 306 end-nodes by the use of WR Switches as 
Boundary Clocks.

We set up a test network composed by a WRS at the top, which is locked to an 
external time reference, another WRS as intermediate BC and a WR-ZEN as 
endpoint. This configuration allows synchronizing up to 306 WR nodes with an 
expected performance similar to the results obtained in our test for the WR-ZEN.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/prueba_red}
	\caption[WR Scalability test's setup for SKA]{To evaluate the scalability 
	of the WR solution for the expected SKA timing network, a sample WR 
	network has been evaluated. At the top there's a WRS as GM, a second layer 
	of WRS to finally provide synchronization to the end-nodes (WR-ZEN).}
	\label{fig:pruebared}
\end{figure}


All the equipment for that test was under laboratory conditions. To connect 
each one of the WR devices we've used a 20km fibre spool and SFPs from 
FiberStore (SFP-GE-BX80 with 1490/1550 nm wavelengths). PPS phase difference is 
measured from the WR-ZEN to the WRS in GM configuration using a Keysight 52320A 
counter along 4 hours.

\end{figure}

TDEV and MTIE values have been calculated by octaves, the numerical 
values can 
be found in Table \ref{tab:netresults}. Graphical representations are included 
in Figures \ref{fig:tdevnet} and \ref{fig:mtienet} respectively. TDEV results 
show that expected synchronization accuracy for the end-nodes is around tens of 
ps. The maximum PPS error during this test is bounded in hundred of ps, which 
is more than enough what SKA needs (2ns).

With those findings, it's proved that a WR network with two levels can provide 
synchronization to all the equipment expected for the SKA facilities. 
Although long-distance fibre links have been used for that test, thermal 
influence should be take into account in order to confirm the goodness of the 
WR solution in the SKA timing distribution. The next experiment will evaluate 
how the temperature change in the fibre link can affect the accuracy of the 
synchronization.

\subsection{Fibre operational temperature influence on time accuracy}
\label{subsec:temp}

One of the key aspects of the timing solution for the SKA facilities is the 
influence evaluation of the external elements in the timing performance. 
Synchronization signals are spread over hundred of nodes which are connected by 
long distance fibre links. Meteorological elements, such as wind or large 
temperature changes, can alter propagation delays over the fibre 
links. The timing solution must compensate appropriately those effects in order 
to maintain the synchronization performance inside the limits required by the 
SKA's infrastructure.

On this contribution, we've focused on the temperature change effect over the 
cable
\textit{round-trip} time (CRTT) and the PPS performance. To evaluate that, we 
own a climate chamber in the laboratory and some fibre spools of tens of 
kilometers. 
We couldn't evaluate properly wind impact with our equipment, because of this, 
the experiments will only determine temperature effect on synchronization.

Theoretically, WR is able to dynamically calibrate the master to slave 
propagation delay from the total \textit{round-trip} time, and therefore PPS 
offset shall maintain constant even when the propagation delay changes. The 
accurate estimation of the one-way propagation delay is achieved by the use of 
a constant value, $\alpha$, which express the ratio between propagation times 
with the two wavelengths used in the WR link. A complete explanation of the 
link model could be read in \cite{Wlostowski2011} and \cite{Daniluk2012}.

In the real world, $\alpha$ is temperature dependent, because of the change in 
the refraction index due to a temperature variation in the fibre. For small and 
mid-distance links, in laboratory conditions, $\alpha$ is nearly negligible and 
the current link model behaves very well. The WR network in SKA will be formed 
by long distance links exposed to external elements. In the concrete situation 
of the South Africa facilities, the chosen location was the Karoo region. 
This region is a semi-desert area, very adequate to reduce human interferences 
in the high resolution data acquisition equipment, but with a inconvenient 
respect to the temperature point of view: desert zones have a high difference 
between day and night temperatures.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/tempsetup}
	\caption[Configuration of the climate chamber experiments]{Experimental 
		setup to analyse the influence of the temperature gradient over the 
		fibre link and the synchronization accuracy.}
	\label{fig:tempsetup}
\end{figure}

We performed a series of experiments introducing a 50 km length fibre spool in 
a climate chamber. The CRTT and the PPS offset between master and slave have 
been measured for a temperature range from 20 ºC to 50 ºC with 10 ºC steps. 
The average temperature difference between day and night in the Karoo region on 
each month is below 20 ºC, so the experiment covers comfortably the expected 
temperature operation conditions.

\end{table*}

Our test is intended to prove the hypothesis that PPS offset is not related to 
the cable \textit{round-trip} time, i.e. changes in CRTT will not affect the 
synchronization accuracy. We have performed a series of experiments where the 
operational temperature of a 50 km fibre link is set in a point from 20ºC to 
50ºC. When the fibre reached the target temperature, we started to measure the 
rest of dependent values such as CRTT and PPS offset. All the WR equipment was 
calibrated in order to compensate the characteristic delays of each device 
following the official calibration procedure \cite{man:calib}.  The test setup 
is depicted in figure \ref{fig:tempsetup}.

The most relevant results are included in Table \ref{tab:temp}: (i) the mean 
value of CRTT and PPS offset samples, and (ii) their sample standard deviation. 
A total of 7200 samples (2 hours) per temperature step have been used to 
compute the presented statistics. The amplitude of the CRTT sampled data is 
96496 ps. Dividing it by the temperature range we obtained a CRTT variation of 
3213 ps/ºC. It's important to remark the huge change in the propagation delay. 
Considering a synchronization system that is not capable of dynamically 
calibrate that change, the final performance would suffer of an enormous 
degradation, which is unacceptable for the SKA equipment. The peak-to-peak 
difference for the PPS offset is 211 ps which leaves us a 7 ps/ºC and if we 
divide by the total link length: $0.14 ps/ºC \cdot km$.

	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:crttvstemp} shows a clear linear dependency between the 
temperature and the CRTT. Although, the PPS offset is not constant as 
we suppose in our initial hypothesis. The Figure \ref{fig:ppsvscrtt} suggests 
an inverse linear dependency between CRTT and offset, but if we take the 
standard error values into account, we can't state clearly that linear 
relation. It must be considered that $\alpha$ is computed experimentally using 
fixed-point arithmetic (the LM32 has no floating-point unit). While it seemed 
to work right for distances lower than a few kilometres, it may be insufficient 
for such long distances as we used in our experiments. Nevertheless, the 
observed offset variation for a long distance link and a 30ºC temperature 
gradient is only 200 ps that joined to the results from the previous 
experiments make the new PPS distribution system suitable for the SKA 
timing system.
