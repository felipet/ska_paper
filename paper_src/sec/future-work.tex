The develop PPS distribution system is working at the moment but it is 
necessary to test in depth in the SKA1 places in order to check all the 
possible scenarios. Specifically, one of the key aspects is the evaluation of 
other wavelengths for the optical link transmissions in order to minimize the 
effect of chromatic dispersion and reduce the PPS offset due to thermal changes 
in the fibre link. Moreover, the solution is flexible enough to be used in 
another first level scientific projects.
