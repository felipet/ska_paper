In spite of the correct functioning of the developed PPS distribution system, 
two aspects must be considered to enhance and improve the functioning of the approach presented in this paper. 
On one hand, the utilisation of different SFPs that present variable wavelengths causing calibration problems.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the timing system in respect to diverse atmospheric
conditions where the WR equipment will be finally placed in the SKA infrastructure in order to detect whether
temperature changes and wind variations are able or not to degrade significantly the PPS accuracy.

Moreover, the solution is flexible enough to be used in another scientific
projects such as CTA. \klyonelnote{Completar un poco esto...} \gutinote{quizas enforcarlo a reutilizacion para otros proyectos, si}
