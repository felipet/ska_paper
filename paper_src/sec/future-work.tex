The develop PPS distribution system is working at the moment but it is 
necessary to test in depth in the SKA places in order to check all the 
possible scenarios. Most important issues needing to be evaluated as part of 
the future work are: (i) the problem with the variable wavelength for the 
current chosen SPFs and their calibration; and (ii) the evaluation of the 
conditions where the WR equipment will be placed in order to detect if the 
temperature change can degrade significantly the PPS accuracy.

Moreover, the solution is flexible enough to be used in another first level 
scientific projects, so that, more specific tests should be performed in order 
to evaluate the developed platform for its inclusion in other projects.
