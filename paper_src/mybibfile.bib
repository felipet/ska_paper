	abstract = {The White Rabbit project is a multi-laboratory and 
	multi-company effort to de- sign a control network based on Ethernet, which 
	provides deterministic data transfer capabilities and an accurate clock 
	synchronization mechanism. This thesis describes in detail the mechanisms 
	used in the White Rabbit network for precise time and frequency transfer 
	(with a master-slave time offset below 1 ns). The first chapter contains an 
	introduction to timing systems with a focus on systems used in particle 
	accelerators. In the 2nd chapter, the reader is presented the basic theory 
	(phase noise, jitter, phase-locked loops) required to understand the 
	operation of such systems. The 3rd chapter describes the White Rabbit 
	network structure and the employed synchronization and syntonization 
	methods (Precision Time Protocol — IEEE 1588 in conjunction with 
	Synchronous Ethernet). The 4th chapter presents a prototype hardware and 
	software design of the key component in a White Rabbit network — the White 
	Rabbit Switch. The last two chapters summarize the results, discuss 
	possible applications and plans for further development.},

	abstract = {To guarantee the angular resolution, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) requires a 500ps (rms) timing synchronization among the 6866 detect units for its KM2A sub-detector array. The White Rabbit technology is applied which combines sub-nanosecond precision timing transfer and gigabit Ethernet data transfer over the same fiber media. Deployed on a wild field at 4300m a.s.l. altitude, the WR network must maintain the precision over a wide temperature range. The temperature effect on a small WR link is measured, and contributions from different components like optical fiber, SFP module, fixed delay on PCB and ICs are separately studied and analyzed. An online real-time temperature correction method was applied based on the result which significantly reduce the synchronization variation from 300 ps to 50 ps in a temperature range of 50 degrees centigrade.},

@article{Dierikx2016,
abstract = {The application of White Rabbit Precision Time Protocol (WR-PTP) in long distance optical fiber links has been investigated. WR-PTP is an implementation of PTP in synchronous Ethernet optical fiber networks, originally intended for synchronization of equipment within a range of 10 km. This paper discusses the results and limitations of two implementations of WR-PTP in existing communication fiber networks. A 950 km WR-PTP link was realized using unidirectional paths in a fiber pair between Espoo and Kajaani, Finland. The time transfer on this link was compared (after initial calibration) against a clock comparison by GPS precise point positioning. The agreement between the two methods remained within ±2 ns over 3 months of measurements. Another WR-PTP implementation was realized between Delft and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, by cascading two links of 137 km each. In this case the WR links were realized as bidirectional paths in single fibers. The measured time offset between the starting point and the end point of the link was within 5 ns with an uncertainty of 8 ns, mainly due to the estimated delay asymmetry caused by chromatic dispersion},
