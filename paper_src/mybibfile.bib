	abstract = {The White Rabbit project is a multi-laboratory and 
	multi-company effort to de- sign a control network based on Ethernet, which 
	provides deterministic data transfer capabilities and an accurate clock 
	synchronization mechanism. This thesis describes in detail the mechanisms 
	used in the White Rabbit network for precise time and frequency transfer 
	(with a master-slave time offset below 1 ns). The first chapter contains an 
	introduction to timing systems with a focus on systems used in particle 
	accelerators. In the 2nd chapter, the reader is presented the basic theory 
	(phase noise, jitter, phase-locked loops) required to understand the 
	operation of such systems. The 3rd chapter describes the White Rabbit 
	network structure and the employed synchronization and syntonization 
	methods (Precision Time Protocol — IEEE 1588 in conjunction with 
	Synchronous Ethernet). The 4th chapter presents a prototype hardware and 
	software design of the key component in a White Rabbit network — the White 
	Rabbit Switch. The last two chapters summarize the results, discuss 
	possible applications and plans for further development.},
